# ColorDetermine2
I am just trying to improve my very old code where I was messing with neural networks back in high school.
I messed around with the training data and attempted to add 3 new entries and I only ended up adding two new ones that I was afraid of adding.
I don't want to touch my old code in fear of breaking it so I don't think I'll revisit it but it is nice to centralize my code into my github from these old sources like JSFiddle
